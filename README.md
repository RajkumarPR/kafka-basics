# Kafka Basics
This is meant to teach the Kafka basics and get started with the guide.

### What is Kafka?
_Kafka is an open-source, distributed event stream platform that collects, stores, and processes real-time data streams at scale._

Let's break down the Kafka definition.
- **Open-source**: A software/code that is free to use and for possible modification and redistribution.
- **Distributed**: Kafka is a distributed system that runs on more than one system, inter-connected by the computer networks.
- **Event stream**: A continuous flow of events. An 'event' can be anything, for example, a click of a link on a website, a Temperature change etc.
- **Collect**: Collect data from source, in Kafka it's called **_Producer_**.

> [!NOTE]
> Kafka was originally developed by [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/) and made open source in 2011.

### Kafka Topic
- A _Topic_ in Kafka is like a table in RDMS which stores similar things.
- The messages or events are immutable in Kafka's topic.
- We can think of Kafka topics as log files.
